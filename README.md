## Installation & Usage

1. **Clone this repository** (for those who want to download everything):

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/piique/ubuntu-tips-and-tricks.git
    cd ubuntu-tips-and-tricks
    ```

   Execute the desired script:

   ```bash
   chmod +x win+v.sh
   ./win+v.sh
   ```

   OR

2. **Directly download and execute `win+v.sh`**:

   Run the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/piique/ubuntu-tips-and-tricks/main/win+v.sh -O win+v.sh && chmod +x win+v.sh && ./win+v.sh
   ```

   This command will download the `win+v.sh` script, make it executable, and run it.
